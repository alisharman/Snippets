	<h3> <3, SNAX</h3>
	<p>SNAX does not sit still long enough to use technologies (pen and paper included), but she agreed to share some of her recipes with I, her trusty go-between, so that I could capture them here.</p>
	<p>SNAX was the resident GUFF chef at Baker House. Sadly, she got banished and SUDS replaced her. She wanted to share some recipes here, but she got so hungry looking at all of the stock photos (thanks, <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a> ) that she abandoned me here. So, in lieu, please enjoy the Grad School Diet</p>
